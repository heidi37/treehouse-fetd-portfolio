# Single Page Portfolio
This was my final project in the Team Treehouse [Front-End Web Development Tech Degree](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/front-end-web-development) program. I completed the program in 2019. [View my Certificate](https://www.credential.net/1700e85d-d29e-493d-a28e-a8c1860459c8#acc.PS7ITKNb)

The objective was to implement a on page portfolio from scratch using all the skills learned in the program
